# Expanded Features - Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the implementation of Vendor Management and a robust Reporting system with PDF/Print capabilities.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Vendor Management (CRUD)
Integrating the logic for vendor management, which was already partially prepared in the CSS/HTML structure.
- **Storage**: Use [storage.js](file:///c:/Users/val_s/.gemini/antigravity/playground/vector-mare/js/storage.js) to manage [vendors](file:///c:/Users/val_s/.gemini/antigravity/playground/vector-mare/js/app.js#488-510) key.
- **UI**: Add views for Vendor List and Vendor Form in [ui.js](file:///c:/Users/val_s/.gemini/antigravity/playground/vector-mare/js/ui.js).
- **Logic**: Wire up navigation and form handling in [app.js](file:///c:/Users/val_s/.gemini/antigravity/playground/vector-mare/js/app.js).

### 2. Reporting & PDF Export
Adding the ability to export data as professional reports.
- **Print System**: Use a specific `@media print` CSS section to format reports for paper/PDF.
- **PDF Export**: Utilize the browser's native `window.print()` functionality, which is the most reliable "no-build" way to generate PDFs.
- **Report Views**: Create specialized views in [ui.js](file:///c:/Users/val_s/.gemini/antigravity/playground/vector-mare/js/ui.js) that are optimized for printing (e.g., "Event Agenda Report", "Client List Report").

### 3. Files to Modify

#### [MODIFY] [style.css](file:///c:/Users/val_s/.gemini/antigravity/playground/vector-mare/style.css)
Add print-specific styles to hide navigation and format tables/cards for paper.

#### [MODIFY] [js/ui.js](file:///c:/Users/val_s/.gemini/antigravity/playground/vector-mare/js/ui.js)
Add [vendors](file:///c:/Users/val_s/.gemini/antigravity/playground/vector-mare/js/app.js#488-510) and [report](file:///c:/Users/val_s/.gemini/antigravity/playground/vector-mare/js/app.js#537-553) views.

#### [MODIFY] [js/app.js](file:///c:/Users/val_s/.gemini/antigravity/playground/vector-mare/js/app.js)
Add event listeners for vendor management, report generation, event time handling, and event status transitions (Finalize Event).

### 5. Individual Reporting and Detail Views
- **Client Details**: Clicking a client card will open a page showing their full info and all their events.
- **Individual Reports**: Dedicated "Print" buttons for specific clients and events, using optimized templates.
- **Interactive UI**: Enhance cards with `cursor: pointer` and hover effects to indicate interactivity.

## Verification Plan
1. **Vendor CRUD**: Create, edit, and delete a vendor.
2. **Event Filtering**: Ensure events can be viewed clearly for reporting.
3. **Checklist Functionality**: Verify that checklist items can be added and toggled for each event.
4. **Print Test**: Trigger `window.print()` and verify (manually/browser subagent) that the layout adapts correctly.
